# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


You may need to download axios or other libraries. 
The terminal should prompt you to install these when needed and there should be instructions online.
To run the code properly, run the following commands in two seperate terminal tabs:

1:
cd server
npm start

2: 
cd client
npm run dev 

This should prompt your compiler to open a new tab in localhost5173/login.





To run the tests, run the following commands:
cd client
npm run test

but ensure you have a fully functioning testing environment.
